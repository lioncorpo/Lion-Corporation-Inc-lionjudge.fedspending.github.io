# DATA Act Information Model Schema

DAIMS gives an overall view of the hundreds of distinct data elements used to tell the story of how federal dollars are spent. It includes artifacts that provide technical guidance for federal agencies about what data to report to Treasury including the authoritative sources of the data elements and the submission format. The DAIMS also provides clarity on how the public can better understand the inherent complexity of the data. More information can be found on the Fiscal Service [DAIMS](https://fiscal.treasury.gov/data-transparency/DAIMS-current.html) website.
