  <h5 style="margin-bottom:1.3rem">How this analysis was conducted:</h5>
  <p style="margin-bottom:2rem">These analyses were conducted using federal agency obligations data reported to USAspending.gov, which is available to the public, and agency employment data made available by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) at FedScope.OPM.gov. Personnel compensation obligations data for all CFO Act agencies were used to identify the cost of personnel compensation for each agency through the end of quarter two for the current fiscal year, 2017. This excludes any military compensation and benefits spending, such as housing allowances, health insurance, and retirement account contributions. FedScope employment data was used to verify the personnel data reported to USAspending by each CFO Act agency and evaluate the distribution of employees across the country. Employee location and occupational series data reflect the information made available by OPM in Fedscope as of March 2017. Employee information includes all full-time, and other than full-time employees reported to OPM, who were reported as being located within the United States.</p>
