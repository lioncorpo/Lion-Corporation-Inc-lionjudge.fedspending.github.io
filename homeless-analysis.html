						<p><b>The Department of Housing and Urban Development plays a lead role in federal efforts to address homelessness, although multiple federal
							agencies manage programs that provide services including education, employment, housing resources, and more. </b></p>
						<p>Our analysis identified 33 federal programs that explicitly flagged homeless individuals as beneficiaries. These included programs that
							named homeless individuals as primary targets of services or as one of the program's target recipient groups.<sup>2</sup>  We found that programs targeting
							homelessness focus either on all individuals experiencing homelessness, or on a subset, such as veterans or youth. These programs provide various
							types of assistance, which we divided into six categories: housing, food, education, employment, health, and support services.</p>
						<p>Federal funding is just one piece of the puzzle - states, municipalities, and other organizations play a large role in providing funding to address
							homelessness. While we did not conduct a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between federal, state, local, and private funding sources for
							programs that alleviate homelessness across the country, numerous examples show that federal funding works as part of a larger network of support.</p>
						<p>For example, the city of New York spent $1.6 billion on homelessness programs in 2017, compared with about $250 million from federal programs (including those where homeless individuals are one of several beneficiaries).</p>
						<p>The city of San Francisco spent $275 million on similar programs in 2017, compared to the $63 million they received in federal funding.<sup>3</sup></p>
						<p>And, to cite an example of private funding, the Church of Latter Day Saints has given $42 million (over the last ten years) to build housing in Salt Lake City.</p>

	<h5>Final Thoughts</h5>
	<p>As these visualizations depict, thousands of people are homeless across the United States. We hope that this analysis show how federal funding impacts homelessness and can
		serve as a useful tool for state and local governments, as well as private institutions, who are working to reduce homelessness. In addition, we chose to conduct this analysis
		because it features data from across multiple federal agencies, which is all available in one dataset. Analysts and users who have ideas for other types of analyses, whether
		featuring contracts or financial assistance across the federal government, can use the Data Lab's Analyst Guide for guidance and hints as they use the data.</p>

	<h5>How we conducted this analysis</h5>
  <p>We conducted this analysis using data from the following sources:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Federal grant award data from <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov">USAspending.gov</a></li>
		<li>Federal program descriptions from the <a href="https://www.cfda.gov/">Catalogue of Federal Domestic Assistance </a>(CFDA)</li>
		<li>Point-in-Time (PIT) estimates of people experiencing homelessness from the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD's) 2017 <a href="https://www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/2007-2017-HIC-Counts-by-CoC.XLSX">Point-in-Time (PIT) Data</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>To accurately determine the amount the federal government spends addressing homelessness, we reviewed federal program descriptions using the CFDA, looking for any mention of
		keywords related to homelessness.</p>
	<p>We developed a ranking system to assess whether individuals experiencing homelessness would directly benefit from these programs, and categorized these programs by the type
		of service they provide.<sup>1</sup></p>
	<p>For example, the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program provides services to homeless veterans looking for jobs, which we classified as employment related. We presented
		these programs to the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, who recommended that we remove several programs where the preponderance of funds went to beneficiaries other
		than individuals experiencing homelessness.</p>
	<p>We used this dataset to identify all grant spending from USAspending.gov for the programs we determined to have a direct relation to homelessness. As part of our analysis,
		we identified two categories of grant awards in USAspending.gov data that are relevant to our work: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>grant awards for a Continuum of Care area (an administrative region recognized by HUD) or were awarded to organizations within its geographic area;</li>
		<li>grant awards that didn't have specific location data; and</li>
		<li>grant awards that supported organizations across a state.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>To create our visualization, we mapped funding amounts for the programs that fell within a Continuum of Care area using mapping files provided by HUD. The data used in this
		story was updated as of January 2018.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> As an example, we included a program managed by the Department of Health and Human Services called <i>Grants for New and Expanded Services under the Health Center Program</i>,
	which provides funding for expanded and sustained national investment in health centers, even though people experiencing homelessness were one type of beneficiary listed, along with
	migrant workers, public housing residents, and others. We did not include programs intended to address poverty or that provide resources for low-income individuals if homeless individuals
	were not specifically mentioned as a type of beneficiary.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup> Federal, state, and local fiscal years do not always align to the same time frame; the purpose here is to make a broad comparison.</p>
