# Financial Data Transparency Town Hall September 26, 2014

With the recent enactment of the “Digital Accountability Transparency Act” (DATA Act) (Pub. L. 113-101), Treasury hosted a Data Transparency Town Hall on September 26, 2014 to kick off the government-wide implementation to the Federal financial transparency legislation.  Senior officials from the White House, Treasury, and all major Federal agencies as well as non-federal stakeholders participated in a one-day town hall meeting devoted to learning about DATA Act implementation, hearing from members of the public about the importance of Federal spending transparency, and learning from experts on what is possible from a technical implementation perspective.

For more information about the meeting, see the [Federal Register Notice](https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2014/09/05/2014-21213/notice-of-the-data-transparency-town-hall-meeting).
