# Elements: Budget Authority Appropriated and Other Budgetary Resources

Thank you for contributing your feedback on this data element—your input and insight was helpful as we worked to finalize the standards.

## Background

a. The DATA Act requires agencies to report several kinds of financial information, including budget authority appropriated by Congress and other budgetary resources made available by Congress.

b. The OMB SF 133 _Report on Budget Execution and Budgetary Resources_ provides the most detailed reporting of budget authority and other budgetary resources in the federal government.  In total, the SF 133 report sub-divides budget authority and other budgetary resources into more than 125 different categories.  Each of these are defined in OMB Circular A-11 Appendix F.

## Context

The Constitution require all federal spending to start with laws passed by Congress.  Article I, Section 9, clause 7 of the Constitution states, in part, “No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law…”  Congress passes laws that provide one or more kinds of budgetary resources for each specific appropriations account.  The agencies administering these accounts incur obligations and make outlays against these budgetary resources.


__Budgetary resources fall into the following broad categories:__


* _Appropriations_, which corresponds to Budget Authority Appropriated in the DATA Act
* _Borrowing authority_, which is a component of the DATA Act’s Other Budgetary Resources
* _Contract authority_, which is a component of the DATA Act’s Other Budgetary Resources
* _Spending authority_ from offsetting collections, which is a component of the DATA Act’s Other Budgetary Resources
* _Unobligated balances_, which is a component of the DATA Act’s Other Budgetary Resources.  


**Section 20 and Appendix F of OMB Circular A-11 define these terms as follows:**


>_Appropriation_ means a provision of law (not necessarily in an appropriations act) authorizing the expenditure of funds for a given purpose. Usually, but not always, an appropriation provides budget authority.
>
>_Borrowing authority_ is a type of budget authority that permits obligations and outlays to be financed by borrowing.
>
>_Contract authority_ is a type of budget authority that permits you to incur obligations in advance of an appropriation, offsetting collections, or receipts to make outlays to liquidate the obligations.  Typically, Congress provides contract authority in an authorizing statute to allow you to incur obligations in anticipation of the collection of receipts or offsetting collections that will be used to liquidate the obligations.
>
>_Spending authority from offsetting collections_ is a type of budget authority that permits obligations and outlays to be financed by offsetting collections.  Offsetting collections usually result from business-like transactions with the public, including (but not limited to) payments from the public to a government account in exchange for goods and services, and gifts or donations of money.  The authority to spend offsetting collections is a form of budget authority.
>
>_Unobligated balances_ are the amount of appropriations or other budgetary resources carried forward from the preceding year and available for obligation without new action by Congress.

Agencies track appropriations, other budgetary resources, and all financial activities in their financial systems.  As is the case in the private sector, agencies use a standard chart of accounts, which is called the United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL), to record their financial transactions.  The USSGL accounts for appropriations and budgetary resources are described in the Treasury Financial Manual Volume I Part 2 Supplement, Section V: Crosswalks to Standard External Reports for Fiscal 2015 Reporting.

## Analysis of Current Definitions

a. The DATA Act requires that agencies report budget authority appropriated and other budgetary resources.  In fact, however, agencies already use, as necessary, one or more of 125 sub-divisions of budgetary resources defined in OMB Circular A-11.  In carrying out reporting required by the DATA Act, OMB should consider using these more detailed break-outs of appropriations and other budgetary resources.

b. The definitions for Budget Authority Appropriated and Other Budgetary Resources in OMB Circular A-11 and other government publications are very technical and are geared to the budget, financial and other communities in the federal government.  While these definitions serve the needs of the intended audience, OMB should consider establishing and publishing an additional set of definitions that the public would find easier to understand.
